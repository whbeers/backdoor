The board is built on the ["Noise Floor"](https://github.com/whbeers/noise_floor) pedal platform, which provides basic power protection, audio IO, and a footswitch with LED indicator.

## Versioning

My pcb designs utilize the following versioning scheme (I'll add to this as I produce more revisions):
 - v0.0XX: A candidate design that has not yet been produced and tested.
 - v0.XX: A design that has been produced, tested, and any initial errors addressed.

## Name
*The name "Backdoor" is a reflection of the nature of the effect (a RAT) and security nerdery.*
